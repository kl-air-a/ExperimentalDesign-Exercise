        "We will define different charging current profiles during the first ten cycles using two parameters. (Note that for a real optimization problem in the lab we often have 3, 4, 5 or even more factors / parameters to vary).\n",

        "- There are two variables that you can change in your measurement and that define your current profile: \"Current Slope\" and \"Current Constant\". Their physical meaning is explained in the lecture notes.\n",
        "- Both your variables can take values between -3 and 3.\n",
        "- During your measurement, you measure the Coulombic Efficiency.\n",
        "- Your goal is to find a Coulombic Efficiency as small as possible by varying the Current Slope and Current Constant.\n",
